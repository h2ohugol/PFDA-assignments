# Assignments Overview
***

This repository contains a series of assignments designed to practice data analysis, visualization, and simulation techniques using Python. Below are the details of each assignment, along with instructions on what is required.

## Assignment 2: Weather Plot
***

### Objective
Create a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment2-weather.ipynb`) that plots the temperature over time using the `dryBulbTemperature_Celsius` column from a provided dataset.

### Instructions
- Use **Pandas** to read in the data.
- Generate a plot that visualizes the temperature (`dryBulbTemperature_Celsius`) over time.
- Ensure the plot is clear and well-labeled.

## Assignment 3: Email Domains Pie Chart
***
### Objective
Create a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment03-pie.ipynb`) that displays a pie chart of people's email domains based on the provided CSV file.

### Dataset
- The dataset is available at this URL:
  [Download CSV](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download)
- The file contains 1000 entries.

### Instructions
- You can either download the data or link to it directly.
- Use the CSV data to extract email domains.
- Plot a pie chart showing the distribution of email domains.
- Ensure the code is clean, concise, and well-commented.

## Assignment 5: Risk Simulation
***

### Objective
Write a program (`assignment_5_risk.py` or `assignment_5_risk.ipynb`) that simulates **1000 individual battle rounds** in the game Risk and visualizes the results.

### Instructions
- Simulate one battle round as a single shake of the dice for 3 attackers and 2 defenders.
- Record the results for all 1000 rounds.
- Create a plot that visualizes the outcomes (e.g., attacker losses, defender losses, win rates, etc.).
- Use your creativity for the visualization; there are no strict guidelines.
